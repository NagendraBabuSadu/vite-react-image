## Design Notes

### Component Design

- **UploadPreview:** Drag-and-drop or click to upload images, with reset/remove functionality.
- **PromptStyleForm:** Input for prompt and dropdown for style selection.
- **GenerateButton:** Mock API calls to generate styled images with retry and abort functionality.
- **History:** Maintains and displays previously generated images, with keyboard accessibility and ARIA labels.
- **LiveSummary:** Displays live summary of the prompt, style, and uploaded image.

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements are focusable via keyboard.
- Focus outlines and `focus:ring` styles are added for visible navigation.
- ARIA attributes added where necessary (`aria-label`, `aria-live`).

### Styling

- TailwindCSS used for layout, spacing, and responsive design.
- Shadows, hover effects, and rounded corners enhance the UI.
- Scrollbars are hidden with `overflow-y-auto` while keeping scroll functionality.

### State Management

- React `useState` for local component state.
- `useEffect` for persisting history to `localStorage`.

### Performance

- Optimized for small image previews.
- Mock API simulates asynchronous image generation with retries.
